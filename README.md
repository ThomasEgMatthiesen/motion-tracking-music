# Motion tracking music
This Maxpatch employs camera input to detect movement in a designated area. When movement is detected, it triggers the playback of 12 individual instrument tracks, depending on the specific field where the motion occurs. Conversely, if no motion is detected, the instruments gradually fade out, allowing users to explore the varied musical contents of each track. This interactive setup encourages playful engagement and dancing as users interact with the system to keep the music 'alive'.
